# üç© Donut - Offline Social Sharing App

Donut is a React Native mobile app that enables users to create and share short text or photo posts offline via Bluetooth with nearby devices. When devices meet, posts automatically sync and "hop" across the local network.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Features
- **Create Posts**: Text posts (max 200 chars) or photo posts
- **Local Storage**: All posts stored locally on device using SQLite
- **Bluetooth Sync**: Automatic post exchange when devices meet
- **Hop Tracking**: Posts increment hop count with each transfer
- **Spam Prevention**: 2-minute cooldown between posts
- **Content Moderation**: Simulated AI content filtering
- **Auto-expiry**: Posts disappear after 24 hours

### Nice to Have
- üç© Donut-themed loading animations
- Hop count display for each post
- Beautiful, modern UI with smooth animations
- Cross-platform (iOS & Android)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Donut
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on device/simulator**
   ```bash
   # Android
   npm run android
   
   # iOS (macOS only)
   npm run ios
   
   # Web (for testing)
   npm run web
   ```

## üì± App Structure

### Screens
- **Feed Screen**: Main feed showing all posts with post creation
- **Sync Screen**: Bluetooth device discovery and synchronization

### Components
- `PostCreation`: Create text or photo posts
- `Post`: Display individual posts with metadata
- `BluetoothSync`: Handle device discovery and sync

### Services
- `PostService`: Post creation, validation, and spam prevention
- `DatabaseService`: Local SQLite storage operations
- `BluetoothService`: Bluetooth device discovery and sync

### Types
- `Post`: Post data structure
- `BluetoothDevice`: Device information
- `SyncResult`: Synchronization results

## üîß Configuration

### Bluetooth Permissions
The app requires Bluetooth permissions for device discovery and sync. These are handled automatically by Expo.

### Camera Permissions
Photo posts require camera and photo library permissions, which are requested when needed.

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

### Android APK
```bash
# Build APK
expo build:android -t apk

# Or use EAS Build
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### iOS App
```bash
# Build for iOS (requires macOS)
expo build:ios

# Or use EAS Build
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create posts using the Feed screen
2. Test spam prevention (2-minute timer)
3. Use Bluetooth Sync to discover devices
4. Test post synchronization between devices

### Simulated Bluetooth
The current implementation simulates Bluetooth functionality for development purposes. Replace the simulation methods in `BluetoothService.ts` with actual Bluetooth APIs for production.

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All posts are stored locally on device
- No data is sent to external servers
- Bluetooth sync only occurs when devices are in proximity
- Content moderation is performed locally

## üöß Development Notes

### Current Implementation
- Uses simulated Bluetooth for development
- SQLite for local storage
- React Navigation for screen management
- Expo managed workflow

### Future Enhancements
- Real Bluetooth LE implementation
- Enhanced content moderation
- Post categories and filtering
- User profiles and customization
- Offline-first architecture improvements
